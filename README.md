# Cost-Optimization-at-Rocinante-AI
The project helps solve the labor cost and labor allocation optimization problem within different projects for a fake scenario of a company named Rocinante AI (Roci) 
In the scenario, Roci helps develop AI and ML software for creating habitable planets by labeling images and videos taken from different spaceships, and feeding the labeled data into an algorithm to determine a planetâ€™s susceptibility to terraformation.

Roci is working with many companies on many projects. They hired people with different skills set and different pays from different countries.
Each project has a specific number of tasks to be completed, and each task takes a particular duration to finish. Roci must find the right number and right mix of skilled resources from the various countries and complete the project in a timely manner with an optimal minimum cost.

We are the operations team of Roci, after an analysis of the problem requirements, concluded that in order to minimize the total cost of servicing its customers based on the capacity, skill mix, and time constraints, the Integer Linear Programming(ILP) Model would help us obtain this result. As such, the operations team formulated the decision variables, the objective function to minimize the cost, and the various constraints. ILP models were run and sensitivity analyses were performed to understand how the total cost of servicing projects varies when some of the parameters like labor rate and the minimum number of highly skilled resources are changed.
